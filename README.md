# MetalDAM

MetalDAM is a metallography dataset from additive manufacturing of steels. All images were kindly provided by ArcelorMittal engineers.

## Labeled dataset

The labeled set contains 42 grayscale images taken with a scanning electron microscope, with resolutions 1280x895 and 1024x703 (after cropping the information band at the bottom).

| Label | Frequency |
|:-|-:|
|0. Matrix|31.86%|
|1. Austenite|58.26%|
|2. Martensite/Austenite|8.96%|
|3. Precipitate*|0.24%|
|4. Defect|0.68%|

(*) The  reduced  size of  the  precipitates  increased  notably  the  effort  of  annotating  these  micro-constituents, so most of them were ignored during the annotation process.

## Unlabeled dataset

An additional set of 164 images obtained from the same materials is available as well.
